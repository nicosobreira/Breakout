# Breakout

## How the game works

The game has 4 basics components, they are:

1. Ball
2. Pad (Player)
3. Blocks
4. Board

### Key Mechanics 

The *Ball* **velocity** change depending on **which panel side it hit**, if the ball hit the **left** side it goes to the **left**, same thing in the **right**.
If the *Ball* hits the *Board* the **velocity invert**.
When the *Ball* hits certain *Blocks* the **movement speed changes**.
The *Player* can be controlled with a **mouse** (the *x value* of the **mouse** stays in the **middle** of the *Pad*) or with **keys**.
The *Blocks* have different **colors** and **give more or less points**.

### Power Ups

For now I won't add any, **but** they made the game **way** more fun!
